The .java files (in net.asantee.gs2d packages) on GS2D and Ethanon projects are duplicate. We plan using symlinks to avoid it but it won't be possible for now (on Windows).
The source files in the Ethanon project will be more up to date most of the time. When building a GS2D pure C++ project consider copying the net.asantee.gs2d package in Ethanon engine.
