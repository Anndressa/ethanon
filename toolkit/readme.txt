ABOUT:
-----

Ethanon Engine is a free 2D game development tool focused on
the recent video cards for hardware acceleration and shader 
effects. EE is best suitable for 2D games with a top-down
view, but it can also be used to develop other styles, such
as side scrollers and shoot'em up games. The main goal of
this engine is to provide high-quality lighting, shadow and
particle effects with an easy to use visual interface and a
simple and direct scripting system.

EE is entirely based on 2D sprites. It uses pixel shaders to
perform the normal map based lighting and supports any kind
of map construction (e.g.: isometric, orthogonal or
hexagonal) because it's based on arbitrarily positioned
entities instead of fixed tiles.

To control the game flow and handle its events, Ethanon
Engine uses AngelScript for scripts, which brings a familiar
C++ syntax to the code. The integration with the scripting
language is pretty simple and easy to understand.
