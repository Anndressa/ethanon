Free 2D game development tool focused on the recent video cards for hardware acceleration and shader effects. It may be used to develop any style of game, such as top-down view RPG&#39;s, side scrollers and shoot&#39;em up games. The main goal of this engine is to provide high-quality lighting, shadow and particle effects with an easy to use visual interface and a simple and direct scripting system.

Please notice that the .gitignore file doesn't include all files that must be ignored yet. I'll fill it during the next days.
